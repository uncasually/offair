Pauli The PSM’s brand new album *OFFAIR: The Power of your Subconscious Mind Vol 1: SPACE* is available to listen to now at the link below.

Pauli The PSM’s new experimental ambient album OFFAIR: The Power of your Subconscious Mind Vol 1: SPACE is a free one-way ticket through the cosmos. Designed to align with the sonic landscape (pre-Babylonian) zodiac signs, listen and escape into outer space by delving deep within your subconscious mind.

Featuring collaborations with veteran NASA astronauts [Ron Garan](https://www.instagram.com/astro.rongaran/) and [Jean-Francois Clervoy](https://www.instagram.com/astro_jfclervoy/), and astrology-themed song titles, the album’s majestic, ear-sizzling percussion is inspired by space and Afrofuturism. The album also features gospel artist [Liz Vice](https://www.instagram.com/lizvice/), artist and member of Harry Styles’ band [Ny Oh](https://www.instagram.com/lookitsnyoh/), Berlin-based musician [Yaffra](https://www.instagram.com/planetyaffra/), British alt-soul musician [Tawiah](https://www.instagram.com/tawiahmusic/) and French composer [Anne Chmelewsky](https://www.instagram.com/annechmelewsky/).

“My first conscious interaction with ambient music came from meeting Brian Eno. I did some recording with him in Africa and as a gift he gave me a signed copy of his album “Music for Airports”. Ever since, I’ve been fascinated with the idea of music being the conduit to providing an out-of-body, paranormal experience. When I’m on tour, the process of creating music has always been my escape. While on the road recently, I worked on this record with a mobile set up in hotels and backstage areas. Creating this music has been very cathartic for me and runs parallel with my intention for the listener to feel a deep level of catharsis when immersed by the music.” - Pauli The PSM
