Pauli The PSM’s new track “SAGITTARIUS feat. Anne Chmeleswky”  is out now. 

Stay tuned for the full album: *OFFAIR: The Power of your Subconscious Mind Vol 1: SPACE*, inspired by the unique characteristics of the (pre-Babylonian) zodiac signs, dropping on January 7. Listen & pre-save the album at the link below.

“My first conscious interaction with ambient music came from meeting Brian Eno. I did some recording with him in Africa and as a gift he gave me a signed copy of his album “Music for Airports”. Ever since, I’ve been fascinated with the idea of music being the conduit to providing an out-of-body, paranormal experience. When I’m on tour, the process of creating music has always been my escape. While on the road recently, I worked on this record with a mobile set up in hotels and backstage areas. Creating this music has been very cathartic for me and runs parallel with my intention for the listener to feel a deep level of catharsis when immersed by the music.

"The stimulus for ‘OPHIUCHUS’ was **INTERNAL MONOLOGUE**. The lost sign of Ophiuchus is characterized as insightful and curious, the meditative and hypnotic vocal performed by Tawiah seeks internal wisdom and knowledge through expression via call and response emphasized with vocals panned far left and right in the stereo field.

"The stimulus for ‘SAGITTARIUS feat. Anne Chmelewsky' was **UNKNOWN PLAYGROUND**. The bubbling represents the sounds of the eye of the storm in the ruling planet, Jupiter.I wanted the single winding modular synth to feel almost like it was swirling around Jupiter’s eye, inducing a sense of synesthesia. I could see and feel deep oranges and reds when creating this music. This was heightened by deep and thoughtful orchestration by composer Anne Chmelewsky adding an acoustic and classical contrast to the analogue electronic foundation of this track.” - Pauli The PSM
