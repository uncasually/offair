Acclaimed Hip Hop producer and beat-maker Oh No’s new album 'OFFAIR: Dr No’s Lost Beach.' The new album combines Oh No's signature production with samples culled from the archival sonor music editions catalogue of Italian library music.

Oh No is the brother of Madlib and the second half of their duo ‘The Professionals.’ 'OFFAIR: Dr No’s Lost Beach' is his 5th solo release following his last solo masterpiece 'Dr No’s Ethiopium.' Pitchfork praised Oh No as the kind of producer who can “make beats out of anything” and on OFFAIR: Dr No’s Lost Beach he does just that merging his Lo-Fi jazz inflected beats with samples from the cult-fav Sonor Music Editions library of Italian music from the 1970s-’80s. Through the samples, Oh No translates the cinematic scores into a daydreamy, beat-driven beach vibe.
