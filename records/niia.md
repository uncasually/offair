OFFAIR: Mouthful of Salt follows Niia's deep obsession with the ocean. "Lost in my descending nostalgia, at times, I thought Iâ€™d never reach the surface again. I wanted to compose a project that emulates an actual underwater dive experience - more specifically my underwater dive experience.

This album has an affinity for water, however sonically it uses no aquatic or actual ocean samples. My hope was to create an auditory illusion through music. We hear sound differently underwater due to sound waves traveling faster in water than in air which creates a distortion. I will never tell you how to experience or listen to music, but I will tell you in the dark with headphones is where you'd find me. Maybe with a blue candle lit." - Niia
