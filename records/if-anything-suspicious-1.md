Much like the real world, the universe of If Anything, Suspicious is as bleak as it is beautiful, as desolate as it is comforting. The brainchild of Anders Fridén, best known as the vocalist of influential Swedish heavy metallers In Flames, it’s a project that distills his feelings into soothing yet ominous soundscapes that are a simultaneous reflection of, and escape from, the harsh realities of day-to-existence.

The focus tracks "Farewell" and "Nodes of Yesod" are available to listen to now. Anders descibes "Farewell" as essentially wishing someone a safe, joyful journey and it’s up to the recipient if it’s an end or beginning. "Nodes of Yesod" captures the feeling of being extremely small, a tiny fragment in an everlasting labyrinth. Balancing being both fascinated and scared at the same time, accepting both. 

Dive into the unknown and dare to challenge yourself by listening to the tracks below. Stay tuned for the full album to be released on December 3.
