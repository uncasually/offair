Much like the real world, the universe of If Anything, Suspicious is as bleak as it is beautiful, as desolate as it is comforting. The brainchild of [Anders Fridén'](http://instagram.com/andersfridn)s, best known as the vocalist of influential Swedish heavy metallers [IN FLAMES](https://www.instagram.com/inflames/), it’s a project that distills his feelings into soothing yet ominous soundscapes that are a simultaneous reflection of, and escape from, the harsh realities of day-to-existence.

The full album 'OFFAIR: Lullabies for the Damned' is available to listen to now. The album is an expression of the pure joy of creation that explores Anders Friden's love of making electronic music and captures the sentiment of rebirth because this was like nothing he’d ever done before.

The release follows two calming singles “Farewell” and “Nodes of Yesod” called “serene” by Blabbermouth and “ethereal” by MXDWN.
