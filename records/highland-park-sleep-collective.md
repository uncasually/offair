*“Music for Water is a devotional offering to the natural world in the form of sound. Most of our planet is made up of water, our bodies too, and we are calmed by the sound of water. This album is an attempt to give back to that source.”* - Tim Anderson and Filip Nikolic of Highland Park Sleep Collective
