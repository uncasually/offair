location: Public Records, Brooklyn, NY
summary: "Angel Olsen’s critically acclaimed album, All Mirrors, was rich in
  sound and influence. To invite fans into the experience of the album, her
  two-piece string section took to the Public Records stage to deconstruct and
  highlight its sonic layers. After a stunning performance, Angel presented a
  truly unique concept. She synched a playback of the album to the 1929 French
  silent film, Aelita: Queen of Mars, a very obscure yet somewhat obvious
  influence to the sound, structure and themes of All Mirrors. "

To unpack what we witnessed, Angel had a conversation with friend and SiriusXM radio host, Jenny Eliscu, and took questions from the room. 

That night, Angel Olsen took the audience on a casual stroll through her creative mind.
