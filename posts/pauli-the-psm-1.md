Pauli the PSM's rescheduled mini-tour celebrated his OFFAIR Records album '*OFFAIR: The Power of your Subconscious Mind Vol 1. SPACE.'* Guests drifted through space as the instrumentals weaved throughout the audience. A big thank you to Floating, Envelop SF, and National Sawdust for partnering on these events!
