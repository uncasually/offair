Madison McFerrin commands a crowd with both her charisma and her talent. While at Public Records, we felt like we were also welcome guests in her world. 

Madison took the crowd through the nuances of her singing, through layers of vocal acapella. We all found comfort in her voice as her natural instrument. 

Her EP, You + I, has more instrumental arrangements, and Madison took the crowd through her influences, playing vinyl from her home collection. 

It started with Stevie Wonder Innervisions. She shared that her Grandfather was the first african American to sign with metropolitan opera, and how that has influenced her family. 

Madison talked about the double meanings behind the songs on her album. Before performing the song, “Try,” she shared the inspiration behind it (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ4vxGOGNOM)) after the experience of singing the national anthem for Hillary Clinton at the Brooklyn Navy Yard upon receiving the nomination to run for president. To overcome an internet of critics is a journey. And the room, all with their phones in their pockets, was here for the full ride. 

Madison shared Radiohead’s OK Computer as a “great album to stretch to.”
