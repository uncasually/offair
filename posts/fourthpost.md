Madison McFerrin commands a crowd with both her charisma and her talent. While at Public Records, we felt like we were also welcome guests in her world as she took the crowd through the nuances of her singing, through layers of vocal acapella. We all found comfort in her voice as her natural instrument. 

In celebration of her first ever vinyl release, You + I EP, Madison McFerrin took us on a journey through her most meaningful musical influences, explorations and personal experiences, playing vinyl from her home collection. She then put it all together on stage, layering harmonies in a cappella sounds that proved that the human voice can be the most powerful, universal instrument.
