OFFAIR006 was planned to be in the Sound Room of Public Records with Orion Sun as she prepared to tour her new album, ‘Hold Space for Me’. Instead of connecting in person, we had the opportunity to share time and space with her, in perhaps the most intimate space an artist can invite us into, her home studio. 


We are thankful to Orion Sun for opening her space, and to those who joined us in the evolution of how we come together for music.
