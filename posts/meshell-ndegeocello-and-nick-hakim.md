Public Records overflowed two times over as we came together to hear the beautiful performances of Meshell Ndegeocello and Nick Hakim in support of Sounds of Saving, a mental health organization that leverages the power of music to save lives.

When we first started OFFAIR in 2019, these were two artists on our dream list. Never did we think they would share the stage on the same night. With such a strong demand for tickets, the artists graciously offered to put on two shows in a row. Each artist played the room like an instrument in a double-header, co-headline that truly felt spiritual.

Much love and appreciation to Sounds of Saving for bringing everything together, to Public Records for being our hosts, to DICE for donating their ticket fees, and most importantly to Meshell Ndegeocello and Nick Hakim for being so gracious to perform two shows back-to-back and pour their hearts out for a cause they care about.

100% of proceeds from the concert and raffle went to benefit Sounds of Saving’s Therapy Grant Fund. You can still and always donate at [soundsofsaving.org](http://soundsofsaving.org/).
