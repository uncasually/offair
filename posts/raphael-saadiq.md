For the first ever OFFAIR show, Raphael Saadiq created a raw environment through which an intimate crowd of his biggest fans could experience the very personal and humanizing, Jimmy Lee, released that same week in late 2019. 

With an acoustic setup, backed by three musicians, the music came forward and clear in the quiet room. To bring context to the album and his inspirations, Raphael hosted a conversation with fashion designer and friend, Kerby Jean-Raymond, who was able to bring out a few production secrets and hidden gems that only the room of phoneless fans could retain. And for that reason, it was like watching a couple of friends just shoot the shit. We were just in the room for it, eyes and ears glued to the masters. Let’s just say you had to be there.
