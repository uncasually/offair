Blake Mills and Chris Weisman moved a roomful of fans who were frozen in the stillness of awe—the Sound Room was quiet. You could hear every detail in the duo’s effects, until the audience erupted in cheers and howls between songs.

The visuals, imagined by Lachlan Turczan, used water and light to project a reflection of the aural vibrations. It felt like we were all inside of their instruments in this experience of sonic mastery.

Mills and Weisman left us all fulfilled and stunned at the same time. We thank them and our family at Public Records for an incredible night
