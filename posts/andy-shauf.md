Fans lined up around the corner for a chance to see singer/songwriter Andy Shauf kick off the 2020 OFFAIR season with an intimate performance of songs from his Anti Records release, The Neon Skyline. From the moment Andy took the stage, the lucky 200 in attendance fell completely silent and hung on his every note. After his set, Andy hosted a discussion with his good friend and producer Sam Evian, during which they got deep on their love of gear and songwriting.
