Moses Sumney awed a packed house at Public Records with a full-on 2-hour set—a musical journey layered in instrumentation, harmonies, audience participation and those moments when you’re overcome by goosebumps. Moses proved that his combination musicianship+showmanship+vocal prowess is unmatched. And the band brought it to a new level. 

The crowd was INTO it. Not just dancing, but singing, screaming, cheering and mesmerized to a level twice their size. 

Moses sated the room with music from his catalog, from the recently released Græ, Part I, and from its upcoming May 15 sequel. As he began the new single, “Cut Me,” he stood on his front monitors to rise above the crowd, raising the level of intensity. 

In the yet-to-be-released, “Bless Me,” which became notorious for its special guests in his recent LA residency, Moses invited the crowd to join. Our voices became part of the song, and the band brought the room closer together. 

Moses is an artist who cannot be contained or categorized. There’s no genre, no note he can’t hit and no limit to what he can do. At one point, he gracefully floated onto the Sound Room floor and parted the crowd to bring us to the promised land.

This was a dream OFFAIR, the kind we hope stays in our memories. We’d like to thank @moses and his band for bringing the house down, elevating our spirits and wowing our minds, @publicrecordsnyc for being gracious hosts, and the many people who came out on such a glorious spring Monday! Until the next one. 

POST-SHOW UPDATE: For everyone who attended, this was likely our very last show before COVID, a perfect etching of live music in our memory that we all carried throughout hibernation. “Until the next one…” this one is the last one we have to look back upon.
