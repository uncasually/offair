“Ever since I could remember I have wanted to use my body and voice to make people come alive.”

The soft, divine femininity of Rotana’s voice powerfully traveled through our bodies as we sat in silence on cushions across the Sound Room floor at Public Records. Her personal experiences of grappling with her spirituality and desire—and her story of being banned from her home country of Saudi Arabia for it—seemed to welcome an interweaving with each of our own.

Alongside Lebanese composer, activist and educator, Hamed Sinno, the two discussed identity, scripture and the notion that perhaps being exiled from something that rejects you could in fact be freeing.Grab photos from the night at our website. Listen to ‘Opening,’ Rotana’s introspective, meditative album with Superposition.

Big thanks to Public Records, Dice, Platoon and Floating for this collab.
